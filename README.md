This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of fruits into multiple categories.
The model is trained on a labeled dataset of fruit images and demonstrates the full pipeline from data loading and preprocessing to training, evaluation, and visualization.

Features:

TensorFlow/Keras-based image classification model
Rescaling, convolution, pooling, and dropout layers
Data visualization using matplotlib
Support for multi-class classification
Easy-to-understand notebook format

Technologies Used:

Python
TensorFlow / Keras
Matplotlib
NumPy
